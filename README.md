# optimum_coding_test

Backend:
I built an API and chose to use the CSV files as the form of storage since i cannot use database in this situation

I can explain the process verbally
because its hard to explain it in writing


FrontEnd:
because of the timeing, I was not able to do the favorites
the plan was to be able to push the add to favorite button and then the userId and the movieId would go into the csv file
and in the User profile page which is another thing i was not able to build because of time
i would have displayed the favorite movies on the user page in a form of a table
its been awhile since i have used react but i have done everything i can with whatever knoleidge i have
I would have also been able to do color schemes if i had the time
by assigning the primary, secoandary, etc.
I know its not fully complete but based on this I know that i can be able to pick up on react
and if you do call me for a technical interview round i can be able to explain my appraoch in details.
I would not have a logout button but instead an avitar with a drop down 
where the user can choose the Profile and Logout

I used cypress test for the unit testing since i am more comfortable with that

if i had more time i could have made the style even better.
